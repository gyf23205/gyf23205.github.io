Hi! I am Yifan Guo, a third-year Ph.D. student at [FD&C/HS Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fdchsl/home) of Purdue Univeristy. I affiliate with Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer engineering and School of Aeronautics and Astronautics and am co-advised by [Prof. Inseok Hwang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ihwang/) and [Prof. Jianghai Hu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jianghai/). I am also having a delightful academic collaboration with [Prof. Chen Wang](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory/full-time.host.html/content/shared/engineering/computer-science-engineering/profiles/faculty/ladder/wang-chen.detail.html) for projects in [SairLab](https://sairlab.org/).  My major research topics include deep learning for robotics applications, physics-informed machine learning, and multi-agent systems. Except for developing algorithms, I also devote my effort on high-fidelity simulation and experiments to make real-world impacts. As a highly motivated researcher and a teamworker, I am looking for an internship position of summer 2026!

Research Interests
======
The major topic of my research is how to use prior knowledge (symbolic algorithms, system dynamics, topology constraints, etc.) to help deep learning models better understand the physical world. This interest targets three major challenges of current robot learning scheme: data burden, generalization ability, and security guarantees. Deep learning models typically require massive amount of data for accurate and stable performance. Such data is usually unavailable or very expensive for real-world robotic systems, which also limits models in their training scenarios. On the contrary, symbolic algorithms (e.g., MPC) do not require any data to run and generalize to unseen scenarios. The dedicate combination of two sides can lead to a **self-supervised** robot learning scheme with **strong generalization ability**. With the appearance of fully explanable symbolic module in the pipeline, regulating deep models with respect to **hard** constraints (e.g., connectivity, collision avoidance) become much more straightforward. I also address these challenges by embedding the physical knowledge into the deep learning system. With the parameter space being confined by the prior knowledge, the searching space of the training process is regulated, leading to better data efficiency, stronger generalization ability, and better conformance to constraints.
